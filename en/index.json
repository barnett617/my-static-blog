[{"content":"What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between hasOwnProperty method and \u0026ldquo;in\u0026rdquo; operator Key point For inherited properties, in will return true and hasOwnProperty will return false.\nExample const obj = {}; console.log(\u0026#39;constructor\u0026#39; in obj); // true console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty(\u0026#39;constructor\u0026#39;)); // false Reference https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/hasownproperty What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between Object.assign and just assign Key Point For single property, direct assignment is good. For multiple properties, Object.assign is nicer.\nReference https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35241790/difference-between-object-assign-and-just-assign How does the second parameter of parseInt method works Key point When using parseInt, the second parameter should be explicitly declaring for some reasons parseInt() will use the second parameter as the radix(base) to parse a string to integer The first parameter(default parameter) should be a string, or it will be transformed into a string by toString method The second parameter should be between 2 and 36 as a valid radix, otherwise the method will return NaN if the second parameter is number but out of valid scope([2,36]) or it will be ignored if not a number The method will return NaN if parsing fails Example All examples below will get the answer 15.\nparseInt(\u0026#34;0xF\u0026#34;, 16); // Because the string starts with \u0026#34;0x\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;F\u0026#34; is valid hexadecimal number, so it will be parsed into integer with the radix 16 parseInt(\u0026#34;F\u0026#34;, 16); // Because the second parameter is a valid hexadecimal number and the first parameter is a valid hexadecimal string, it works parseInt(\u0026#34;17\u0026#34;, 8); // \u0026#34;17\u0026#34; is parsed into integer with 8 as radix -\u0026gt; 8 + 7 = 15 parseInt(021, 8); // (This maybe confused) Because the first parameter is a number rather than a string, it will be transformed into a string first using toString method. (021).toString() -\u0026gt; 2 * 8 + 1 = 17 =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;17\u0026#34;, then it is the same to the last example parseInt(\u0026#34;015\u0026#34;, 10); // Because the second parameter is 10, the first character \u0026#34;0\u0026#34; will be ignored parseInt(15.99, 10); // 15.99 will be transformed into valid string \u0026#34;15.99\u0026#34;, then the parsing process will terminate when meeting the first invalid string, the dicimal point(\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;) parseInt(\u0026#34;15,123\u0026#34;, 10); // The parsing process will terminate when meeting the invalid character, the comma parseInt(\u0026#34;FXX123\u0026#34;, 16); // (This maybe confused) Because the second parameter is a valid radix(16), the parsing process will proceed correctly until meeting the first invalid character(\u0026#34;X\u0026#34;) then terminate parseInt(\u0026#34;1111\u0026#34;, 2); // 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 1 =\u0026gt; 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 =\u0026gt; 15 parseInt(\u0026#34;15 * 3\u0026#34;, 10); // \u0026#34;15\u0026#34; is a string that can be parsed into a valid number and the spaces will be ignored during parsing process but terminates when meeting the invalid character \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; parseInt(\u0026#34;15e2\u0026#34;, 10); // The same as the above example except the first invalid character is \u0026#34;e\u0026#34; parseInt(\u0026#34;15px\u0026#34;, 10); // The first invalid character is \u0026#34;p\u0026#34;

For this project, we received a lot of driver users\u0026rsquo; appreciation and gained more notabilities. I got more familar with wechat platform ablities and apis such as jump from native, set up a liveshow, and buy things use wechat pay. I had gained more experience of developing a big operating activity project personal and find the right way of achieving it, such as by reading the right official document and find the right other team to support you. Upgrade the function of drivers\u0026rsquo; interviews S we have a lot of new driver users who need to be interviewed and then be our legal backend users, the old way to interview drivers need a lot of interviewers offline and has to order drivers to go to our specific place to accomplish the interview T I need to build some webapps that support drivers to finish the interview online and our checkers can check the drivers\u0026rsquo; interview process asynchronizely, and the core webapp need some native app abilities such as recording voices, make video of interview process, capture face and body part and so on. A I build a standalone webapp and work with our native app developer that supply me the native ablitity and backend developer who supply me the interview content and judge the drivers\u0026rsquo; answer that submitted. I frequently communicate with the native app develops that is an iOS developer and an Android developer, because I was getting familar with the team\u0026rsquo;s jssdk and jsbridge during the project. We talked and designed new bridge functions which can suit this project together, then I wrote documents for the new bridges and communicate with native developers in time to ensure the bridges' changes R Finally, I deployed the webapp online and updated our jsbridge by publishing our npm package to support the new functions, the function online served both driver uses and our audits by increasing more drivers\u0026rsquo; interview commits and make audits\u0026rsquo; work more flexible. It indirectly save our cost on clarifying new driver users and be a continuous function for our main app for drivers.
