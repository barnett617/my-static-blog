me Finally, I develop the core function of buying things from liveshow and coroperate with our backend developer R Finally, I finished a h5 which supplied to jump to miniprogram, a function in miniprogram which supports to watch liveshow and buy things. For this project, we received a lot of driver users’ appreciation and gained more notabilities. I got more familar with wechat platform ablities and apis such as jump from native, set up a liveshow, and buy things use wechat pay. I had gained more experience of developing a big operating activity project personal and find the right way of achieving it, such as by reading the right official document and find the right other team to support you. Upgrade the function of drivers’ interviews S we have a lot of new driver users who need to be interviewed and then be our legal backend users, the old way to interview drivers need a lot of interviewers offline and has to order drivers to go to our specific place to accomplish the interview T I need to build some webapps that support drivers to finish the interview online and our checkers can check the drivers’ interview process asynchronizely, and the core webapp need some native app abilities such as recording voices, make video of interview process, capture face and body part and so on. A I build a standalone webapp and work with our native app developer that supply me the native ablitity and backend developer who supply me the interview content and judge the drivers’ answer that submitted. I frequently communicate with the native app develops that is an iOS developer and an Android developer, because I was getting familar with the team’s jssdk and jsbridge during the project. We talked and designed new bridge functions which can suit this project together, then I wrote documents for the new bridges and communicate with native developers in time to ensure the bridges' changes R Finally, I deployed the webapp online and updated our jsbridge by publishing our npm package to support the new functions, the function online served both driver uses and our audits by increasing more drivers’ interview commits and make audits’ work more flexible. It indirectly save our cost on clarifying new driver users and be a continuous function for our main app for drivers.

For this project, we received a lot of driver users&rsquo; appreciation and gained more notabilities. I got more familar with wechat platform ablities and apis such as jump from native, set up a liveshow, and buy things use wechat pay. I had gained more experience of developing a big operating activity project personal and find the right way of achieving it, such as by reading the right official document and find the right other team to support you.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=upgrade-the-function-of-drivers-interviews>Upgrade the function of drivers&rsquo; interviews<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#upgrade-the-function-of-drivers-interviews>#</a></h2><ul><li>S<ul><li>we have a lot of new driver users who need to be interviewed and then be our legal backend users, the old way to interview drivers need a lot of interviewers offline and has to order drivers to go to our specific place to accomplish the interview</li></ul></li><li>T<ul><li>I need to build some webapps that support drivers to finish the interview online and our checkers can check the drivers&rsquo; interview process asynchronizely, and the core webapp need some native app abilities such as recording voices, make video of interview process, capture face and body part and so on.</li></ul></li><li>A<ul><li>I build a standalone webapp and work with our native app developer that supply me the native ablitity and backend developer who supply me the interview content and judge the drivers&rsquo; answer that submitted.</li><li>I frequently communicate with the native app develops that is an iOS developer and an Android developer, because I was getting familar with the team&rsquo;s jssdk and jsbridge during the project. We talked and designed new bridge functions which can suit this project together, then I wrote documents for the new bridges and communicate with native developers in time to ensure the bridges'
changes</li></ul></li><li>R<ul><li>Finally, I deployed the webapp online and updated our jsbridge by publishing our npm package to support the new functions, the function online served both driver uses and our audits by increasing more drivers&rsquo; interview commits and make audits&rsquo; work more flexible. It indirectly save our cost on clarifying new driver users and be a continuous function for our main app for drivers.</li></ul></li></ul></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://www.wilsonpage.com/en/posts/2023-07-11-js-basic/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>JavaScript Basic Points</span>
